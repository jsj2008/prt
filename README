                        prt framework
                        =============

`prt` is a shorthand for `prerequisite` and as such forms a basis for building
OpenGL ES accelerated applications on top of battle-tested open source 
solutions like `SDL`, `Assimp`, `GLM` and `stb_image`. On top of these
interfaces `prt` provides additional data structures for comfortable handling
of most common tasks:
 * key/value handling
  * avl tree
  * hashtable
  * sparse hashtable with lazy allocated buckets
  * FastHash for small and effecient key/value semantics with up to 100 elements
 * runtime
  * resource manager
  * asynchronous loading
  * locking and wait handle management
  * JSON effect description
  * texture loading (png, jpg)
  * mesh loading (configurable via assimp)
   * mesh graph flattening
  * string pool
 * rendering
  * kd-tree
  * deferred renderer
  * render list is secondarily (primarily by `render_info->order`) sorted by the 
    amount of OpenGL state changes needed for rendering
  * basic primitive rendering
  * sub-system rendering
  * currently only Vertex and Fragment shaders are supported
 * other
  * fast popcnt implementation for x86_64 and Aarch64
  * doubly linked lists
  * logging
  * wrap/overflow safe `size_t` / `ssize_t` operations
  * string functions
  * hashing
  * etc.

Build
=====

On Fedora 22, you're going to need these packages:

```
autoconf automake git make which clang libtool assimp-devel
glm-devel SDL2 SDL2-devel mesa-libGL mesa-libGLES mesa-libGL-devel
mesa-libGLES-devel gcc-c++
```

Or use the Dockerfile.
